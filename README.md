# LibrarySystem

LibrarySystem is a system for handling a simple library database filled with books and movies.

## Installation

To download and use this software, simply download the repository as a zip file, unpack it on your local machine and import the folder to your IDE. Under the src folder, simply run the main.java file to run the software.

Running the software straight from the CMD is also possible.

## Usage

The way the program works is that the console will let you enter different commands to add, remove and check different items in your library database. Such parameters as Title names, value of the product, author etc are added to each product.
The software also allows you to lend an item to a customer and registers the name and number of that customer to make sure you can keep track of who is currently lending what item.
 

Available commands:

* **REGISTER** - Add a product to the library.
* **DEREGISTER** - Remove a product from the library.
* **CHECKOUT** - Check out a product to a specifik customer from the library.
* **CHECKIN** - Check in a product from the customer.
* **LIST** - Gives you a full list of all the products in the library, including checked out products.
* **INFO** - Gives you full info about a product.
* **QUIT** - Exits the program.

Some commands require the user to enter an argument in form of an **ID number**, these commands are: *deregister*, *checkout*, *checkin*, *info*.
You can also always see the available commands directly in the program by typing "help".
