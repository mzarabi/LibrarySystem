LibrarySystem is a system for handling a library filled with books and movies.

## Usage

The program works so that the console asks for a command that the user enters to use and do various things, such as registering or lending a product. 

Available commands:

* **REGISTER** - Add a product to the library.
* **DEREGISTER** - Remove a product from the library.
* **CHECKOUT** - Check out a product to a specifik customer from the library.
* **CHECKIN** - Check in a product from the customer.
* **LIST** - Gives you a full list of all the products in the library, including checked out products.
* **INFO** - Gives you full info about a product.
* **QUIT** - Exits the program.

Some commands require the user to enter an argument in form of an **ID number**, these commands are: *deregister*, *checkout*, *checkin*, *info*.
You can also always see the available commands directly in the program by typing "help".
